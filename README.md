This repository contains a sophisticated movie recommendation engine leveraging reinforcement learning to optimize recommendation pipeline efficiency. Inspired by Netflix's research project *InTune: Reinforcement Learning-based Data Pipeline Optimization for Deep Recommendation Models*, InTuneRecSys enhances traditional recommendation models by implementing an RL-based pipeline optimization for real-time, dynamic resource allocation.

## 🚀 Project Overview

InTuneRecSys integrates traditional recommendation methods (content-based, popularity-based, and collaborative filtering) into an advanced pipeline that combines these models with reinforcement learning. The RL agent dynamically allocates computational resources, optimizing throughput and reducing latency, thus delivering high-quality recommendations efficiently.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Resource Optimization**: Inspired by Netflix’s InTune, an RL agent automatically adjusts CPU count, batch sizes, and other resources based on real-time pipeline performance, ensuring high throughput and low latency.
- **Multi-Model Recommendation Engine**: Incorporates content-based, collaborative filtering, and popularity-based recommendations, enhanced by ensemble learning.
- **Personalized and Scalable**: Uses the MovieLens dataset to provide personalized recommendations tailored to user preferences across a massive dataset of over 45,000 movies and 26 million ratings.

## 📊 Business Impact

Applying reinforcement learning to pipeline optimization in recommendation systems offers substantial business benefits:

- **Improved User Satisfaction**: By delivering faster, more relevant movie suggestions, InTuneRecSys can increase user engagement and satisfaction with content offerings.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Optimizing the pipeline's resource usage reduces idle time and maximizes throughput, lowering computational costs and enabling more scalable recommendation services.
- **Enhanced Personalization**: By combining multiple recommendation models and refining recommendations through RL optimization, InTuneRecSys offers a more personalized user experience, tailored to individual viewing preferences.
- **Cost Savings**: By utilizing system resources more efficiently, InTuneRecSys reduces overall computational costs, aligning with operational goals in large-scale recommendation engines.

## 🧠 Technical Details

This project builds on concepts from the Netflix InTune research paper:

- **Reinforcement Learning-Driven Optimization**: A reinforcement learning agent dynamically adjusts pipeline resources, mirroring InTune’s approach to balancing data-loading throughput with computational efficiency.
- **Data Pipeline Optimization**: Inspired by InTune’s findings, this project addresses data ingestion bottlenecks by managing CPU resources effectively, reducing latency, and increasing data throughput across various recommendation models.

### Dataset

InTuneRecSys utilizes two datasets from MovieLens:
- **Full Dataset**: 45,000 movies, 26 million ratings, 270,000 users.
- **Small Dataset**: 9,000 movies, 100,000 ratings, 700 users.

The Full Dataset is used to build a generalized recommendation engine, while the Small Dataset supports more personalized models.

### Algorithms Implemented
- **Simple Recommender**: Offers popular movies by vote count and rating, ideal for general recommendations.
- **Content-Based Recommender**: Suggests movies similar to a user-provided title, using metadata like genres, cast, and keywords.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for personalized recommendations based on user preferences.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines content-based and collaborative filtering for more accurate, personalized recommendations.
- **RL-Enhanced Model**: Reinforcement learning dynamically optimizes pipeline throughput, improving real-time recommendation delivery.

### Key Metrics
- **CPU & GPU Utilization**: Measures the RL agent's efficiency in resource allocation, reducing idle times and optimizing resource distribution.
- **Latency and Throughput**: Evaluates the speed and performance of data-loading and processing in the recommendation pipeline.
- **Prediction Quality**: Assessed by Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for collaborative filtering and hybrid recommendations.

## 🔧 How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/InTuneRecSys.git
   cd InTuneRecSys


Sample Code

Here’s a snippet of the RL-enhanced recommendation function that dynamically adjusts resources based on movie preferences and system load:
```bash
def rl_improved_recommendations(title):
    agent = RLAgent()  # Initialize RL agent
    idx = indices[title]
    sim_scores = sorted(list(enumerate(cosine_sim[idx])), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[1:26]
    movie_indices = [i[0] for i in sim_scores]
    movies = smd.iloc[movie_indices][['title', 'vote_count', 'vote_average', 'year', 'description']]
    
    # RL optimization to dynamically adjust resources
    for _ in range(10):
        action = agent.select_action(state)  # Choose action based on state
        # Update CPU count, batch size, etc., based on the action taken
        state['cpu_count'] = max(1, state['cpu_count'] + action['cpu_increment'])
        state['batch_size'] = max(1, state['batch_size'] + action['batch_increment'])
    
    # Display top recommendations and resource optimization details
    return movies
```
